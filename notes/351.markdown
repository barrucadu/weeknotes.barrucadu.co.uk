### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week was a pretty cool session indeed.  Firstly, I dropped a plot hook on
the party.  There are a few of these listed in the introduction to Arden Vul,
but I haven't tended to use them as the players are pretty self-directed, but I
felt like mixing things up.  An archmage of one of the imperial collegia hired
them to find a pair of magic swords she had a lead on, she gave them enough
information to get going, a down payment, and a flexible deadline: ideally
within the month.

After that, we spent most of the session sneaking around to learn more about two
of the party's big goals: war against the Cult of Set, and finding all the
rudishva.  The session ended with the party's assassin, disguised as a Set
Acolyte, fleeing the Inn of the Lost after breaking into Thegan's room, stealing
his diary, and starting a fire.  The escape all came down to a very critical
initiative roll to determine whether Thegan could leap across the flaming bed to
grab her.

Session 100 inches ever closer, and it's a toss-up as to whether that session'll
be the start of open war against the Cult of Set, or a heist mission to bust
Isocorax out of the Inn of the Lost.


## Miscellaneous

This week the paint samples finally arrived, and I've picked the ones I want to
use:

- [Basically Black][] for the living room and office
- [Forest Shade][] for the master bedroom
- [Honey Mustard][] for the guest bedroom

The painter's booked for the 7th.  It'll be great to finally get this
redecoration done, though I'm going to start assembling furniture and moving
things into rooms (even if I don't, say, unpack all my books yet) once the
carpet is done next week.

With everything still packed, it doesn't feel like I've moved in yet.

I've also ordered the art for the hall, stairs, and landing.  Those being:

- [Pinecrabs][] for the hallway, above a cabinet in which I'll hide the router
- [Blue Heron][], [The Electric Tower][], and [Great Horned Owl][] up the
  stairs, which curve around 180 degrees so I have three walls to play with
- [Fiji Mermaid][] for the upper landing, probably above a cabinet or something
  though I'm not sure yet

I'm leaving the living room, office, and bedrooms until after the painting.  I
have a fairly good idea what I want in all those rooms, but I want to see them
painted first.
