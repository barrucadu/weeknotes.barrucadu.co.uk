## Books

This week I read:

- [The Library at Mount Char][] by Scott Hawkins

  I got this for Christmas in 2022, and got so into it I read it in a single
  day, almost non-stop.  This week I decided to read it again, to see if it
  still held up (while stuck back at home, a book doesn't have to be *that*
  amazing to be a welcome break); and it did, I could hardly put it down.

  [Last time][], I felt the ending was a little weak.  But this time around I
  felt that I was maybe being too harsh.

## Roleplaying Games

This has been a good week for kickstarters: [Wildendrem][] opened its backerkit,
so I've now paid for shipping for that, and [Dolmenwood][] will be following
suit tomorrow; [Nightmare over Ragged Hollow][] arrived in the post; and the
[Pioneer][] playtest should be coming soon, just in time for our next one-shot.

### The Halls of Arden Vul

Another successful session, with the players heading into newly-discovered
territory and making off with some loot.  Unfortunately for them, this area is
fully under the control of one of the dungeon factions---an especially paranoid
one at that---and there will be consequences to this incursion.  Fortification,
at the very least.  I need to think things over, but this entrance they've found
may just end up lost to them (e.g., the stairwell collapsed, rendering it
impassable without major work).

But their interest has definitely been piqued, and they have clues leading to
another entrance, so maybe losing this entrance will just spur further
exploration.  But the route to the other entrance is now the home of a monster
they accidentally unleashed.  That monster, by the way, is breeding now that
it's got more space, and it could cause a major infestation if left unchecked.

Consequences!


## Miscellaneous

I spent some more time this week working on [my DNS nameserver][].  No new
features this week, just some refactoring, but it's satisfying work.  I've done
nothing but merge version bump PRs since June, and yet recently I've been
inspired to fiddle with it.  Is it something I ate?

I also bought some plane tickets.  To Japan.  For next April.  Some online
friends are going for a few weeks, and I'll be joining them.  We've not met in
person before, so this'll be fun.  I'm also going to take advantage of the trip
to see a couple of other friends who will be living in Japan at the time.  It's
a long way off still, but I'm excited.  This'll be my first trip abroad in a
while, and I really liked Japan last time I was there.
