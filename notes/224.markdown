## Books

It was Christmas last week, and so of course I got some new books: some RPG
stuff (in the next section); a chilli cookbook; volumes 9, 10, and 12 of [That
Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime][] (volume 11 was apparently temporarily sold
out); [Homo Deus][] (my dad has a habit of getting me books he thinks I should
read); [The Library at Mount Char][]; and [Perdido Street Station][].

This week I read:

- [The Library at Mount Char][] by Scott Hawkins

  Wow, this one was a surprise!  I knew it was pretty well-regarded, and the
  premise hooked me, but once I started I just couldn't put it down.  Hard to
  believe that this is the author's first foray into fantasy, and that he
  normally writes dry technical Linux books.  It's pretty fast-paced, there were
  twists I didn't see coming, and I like the America-with-hidden-magic setting.
  If I have any criticism, it's that the ending felt a little weak.  But not
  weak enough to spoil what came before, just not as good as it could have been.
  
  One part which stood out to me was how the character who studied animals found
  it difficult to speak human languages and even think like a person after a
  while, and so gave the impression of being a bit slow; but then we get a scene
  with him speaking to a lion, from the lion's perspective, and he's eloquent
  and clearly smart, it's a nice contrast to how the human characters see him
  and how we've seen him until then.
  
  The author's said he [tried to start on a sequel][] but there are no firm
  plans on actually finishing and publishing it, since he doesn't want a
  lacklustre book.  Which is fair enough, but if he does write one I'll
  definitely read it.

## Roleplaying Games

I got the [A Time to Harvest][] campaign (for Call of Cthulhu), and also bought
myself the ALIEN RPG core book and GM screen on a whim:

Sadly, while I love Call of Cthulhu, my players are less keen.  They like it,
they just like other things *more*.  So that book will probably sit around
unplayed (but not unread) for a while.  On the other hand, I've managed to drum
up some interest in ALIEN, so I'll run a one-shot of that in the near future.

And, not that the players know it yet, but the next session of my Traveller
campaign is going to feature a very ALIEN-inspired abandoned mining colony...
