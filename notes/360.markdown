## Books

This week I read:

- [The Deep and the Dark][] from Mongoose Publishing

  Reaver's Deep is another fun frontier region with the Imperium, Solomani
  Confederation, and Aslan Hierate all being present, along with a variety of
  interstellar states.  It's a frontier powderkeg, much like the Trojan Reach
  (my preferred campaign locale) and the Spinward Marches (the traditional
  Traveller campaign setting)---it's easy to see why these places are popular.
  Dark Nebula is almost entirely dominated by the Solomani Confederation and
  Aslan Hierate, with a smattering of independent worlds, and seems much more
  suited to a political game.  The book has a lot of good info on all these
  factions, which would be useful in games set elsewhere too.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week we had a full house again and got back to some good old fashioned
adventuring.  The players set off in pursuit of a pair of magic swords they've
heard tell of, and have ended up in the right sort of area but still have a ways
to go.  Naturally, they've turned away from the actual route to the swords
deciding---for some reason that I didn't quite catch---that the swords can't be
*that way*, and are looking elsewhere.
