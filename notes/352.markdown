I'm feeling a bit under the weather today, so a very abbreviated weeknote.


## Books

This week I read:

- [The Ritual][] by Adam Nevill

  Last read [in 2020][]!  I've also picked up a few more Adam Nevill books to
  read over the coming weeks.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week was mostly preparation for beginning the big war against the Cult of
Set, which we're aiming to begin in session 100: next week.  The major happening
is the negotiation with the Sun-Scarred Knights.  Unfortunately, we had to cut
the session a bit short as I started to have internet issues (more on that
below), so we'll probably finish off negotiations via chat before next time.


## Miscellaneous

I've been having periodic bouts of slow internet since it was set up, that
appeared to be Google specific:

- The youtube web interface is laggy, taking a noticeably long time to load and
  sometimes times out
- When I download a youtube video, the download speed hovers around 50KiB/s
- My Pixel phone took about 8 hours to download a 3.12GB update
- Pulling docker images from mirror.gcr.io (the Google Container Registry)
  frequently times out
- Articles on Blogspot (owned & operated by Google) load slowly, and images
  frequently fail to load
- This week: Discord voice chat, which goes through Google Cloud, became
  unusably garbled

The internet connection in general appears to be fine otherwise, and
speedtest.net shows consistently good speeds even while I'm simultaneously
having issues with Google.

Firing up [mtr][] revealed some bad news:

Oof.  7% packet loss with ping occasionally spiking to 3s.  Here's a trace to

Much better.

10.0.0.1 is my router, so it certainly appears to be something in the ISP's
network.  Notably, 31.41.250.109 doesn't appear in the good trace, whereas in
the youtube trace some packets went via 31.41.250.97 and some via 31.41.250.109.
So maybe 31.41.250.109 is the issue.

For some reason my ISP only lets you submit support tickets during working
hours, so I'll be doing that first thing tomorrow.
