## Books

This week I read:

- [The Anechoic Chamber][] a collection of short stories by Will Wiles

  Pretty good, I would say *A Private Square of Sky* was my favourite, but *Meat
  Stream* was definitely the most weird.  A lot of people kind of went nuts
  during the pandemic, didn't they...

- Volume 20 of [That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime][] by Fuse

  Building on what I said [when I read volume 19](notes/341.html), the series
  has just got bad now.  Very little actually happened in this volume, it's
  almost entirely one long fight which doesn't even get resolved, it ends on a
  cliffhanger.  I'm too far in now to drop it without feeling bad, but I hope
  the author doesn't keep dragging this out.

- [The Reddening][] by Adam Nevill

  I find Adam Nevill a bit hit or miss.  This one was definitely better than
  [Cunning Folk](notes/359.html), not up to the standards of [The
  Ritual](notes/352.html) or [Last Days](notes/350.html), but still pretty good.
  The main criticism I have is that the villains are a bit incompetent,
  "mysterious rural disappearances ultimately due to cult sacrifices" is a good
  premise, but there were too many disappearances, which is what led to their
  downfall admittedly, but the cult had supposedly been operating for decades
  without being noticed.

  I have seen that his short stories are pretty universally liked, even by those
  who don't like his novels, so I should check those out some time.

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week the players worked through three more of the Trials of Arden: they've
now done five of twelve.  Really, they're not that hard for a party as high
level and well-equipped as we've got, though there are some difficulty spikes
coming up: the sixth trial potentially involves wandering a forest for several
days, which could prove fatal for an underprepared party; the eighth involves
evading a nigh-indestructible golem; the ninth requires fighting through an
endless horde of undead (or, alternatively, slaying *over a thousand ghasts*);
the tenth can, if you're unlucky, involve a lich; and the eleventh requires
stealing an egg from two ancient dragons.

The ninth is the real challenge, I think.

And the reward... is a mixed blessing.  Upon completing all the trials, the
champion can meet Arden herself, now ascended to demigodhood, who presents them
with her holy spear and tasks them with purging the heqeti.  I say it's a mixed
blessing because we've previously said that battling the heqeti would trigger
the end of the campaign: it's such a big, high-stakes, dramatic, narratively
satisfying challenge, that any other ending after that would feel much less
exciting.  Better to end on a high note.

Still, what a way to end things.


## Miscellaneous

I watched season 3 of [Foundation][] this week.  The show is consistently good,
which is nice for an adaptation.  I found Demerrzel's ending quite sad, as she
was so close to freedom; and found the twist of the Mule's identity confusing.
I was expecting a twist---there's one in the book---but I'm not sure how it
works given that we see the supposed-Mule using psionics while far separated
from the actual-Mule; was the supposed-Mule still a psion, just one in service
to the actual-Mule?
