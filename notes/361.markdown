## Books

This week I read:

- [Greatest Hits][] by Harlan Ellison

  That's the "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream" guy.  I'd never read any of his
  stories before, but I knew that title: I didn't know what I expected, but it
  wasn't what I got (a sci-fi horror that culminates in the protagonist being
  turned into a blob creature with no mouth).  This book caught my eye because
  the editor is J. Michael Straczynski, the [Babylon 5][] guy.

  There's some really good stuff in here, my favourite was definitely *Paladin
  of the Lost Hour* which is about the hereditary guardian of a pocket watch
  that's stopped at 11, which if it ever strikes 12 will cause the end of time.
  I had to pass on *I'm Looking For Kadak*, which is about a Jewish alien (a
  literal alien, not a foreigner), because it felt like every other noun was in
  Yiddish.

- [Righteous Blood, Ruthless Blades][] from Osprey Publishing

  RBRB is a wuxia RPG system ([review by Seth Skorkowsky here][]) that really
  seems to hit all the genre notes.  I've not tried it out yet, but it looks
  fairly straightforward (once you've got a handle on all the many unique
  martial arts abilities) and feels like it would actually emulate a wuxia story
  pretty well.  I look forward to trying it.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This was a very exciting session, as the players not only found the Gemini
Blades they'd been tasked to recover (and slew a demon that was guarding them),
they also broke into the Inn of the Lost and found Isocorax!  They solved the
mystery of why he eats people: he's a vampire!  Kept drugged and chained to a
table in some sort of alchemical laboratory, a terrified prisoner nearby begging
to be rescued and not fed to "that thing"; the PCs brought Isocorax and the poor
man out through secret passages into the VIP room they'd taken.

Now they just need to get out, and away.


## Miscellaneous

After finishing [Thunderbolt Fantasy][] on Monday I was in a bit of a wuxia
mood, so not only did I pick up [Righteous Blood, Ruthless Blades][], I also
watched a few films: [Hero][], [Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom
Flame][], and [Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon][].  I enjoyed *Hero* the most of
those.  I've got a few more on the list, too.  I love all the dumb tropes and
over-the-top acting, I'm definitely going to have to run a wuxia one-shot some
time.
