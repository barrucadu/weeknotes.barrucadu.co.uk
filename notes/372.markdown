### The Halls of Arden Vul

Back to Arden Vul this week.  This time the players returned to the Forge of
Zhorak and explored around the area some more, they got a hint of how it's
connected to the wider map (always useful to be able to go places without
teleporting), met some strange men eating demon meat, and that's about it
really.  Not much action, but a lot of dungeoncrawling.


## Miscellaneous

I finished watching [Alien: Earth][], pretty good.  Though the ALIEN timeline is
a mess, I'm not sure how xenomorphs loose on Earth is supposed to fit in with
the rest of the canon.  You just have to treat all ALIEN things as only loosely
connected and not think about it too hard.
