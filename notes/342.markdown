No books this week.

### The Halls of Arden Vul

The session this week was a bit all over the place, one player was absent and
another dropped out part way through due to feeling unwell, so we mostly just
wrapped up a few loose ends, gathered some rumours, communed with the gods, and
carried out some treasure.


## Miscellaneous

### AI

Inspired by a blog post about "[Stevens][]", an AI assistant that sends the
creator a daily briefing based on their calendar, emails, and things they've
asked it to remember, I decided to have a go at making my own.

So here is [Willikins][]: a discord bot that pulls data from my calendar, and
can also subscribe to and summarise RSS feeds.  Here's an example of the daily
briefing:

> Good morning, sir. I present your daily briefing for Saturday, the 19th of
> April, 2025.
>
> **Today**
>
> You have Weekly chores scheduled from 10:00 to 11:30 this morning.
>
> **Looking Ahead**
>
> For tomorrow, Sunday the 20th, you have your regular Halls of Arden Vul
> engagement from 17:00 to 20:00, with preparation beforehand at 16:30.
> Following the session, you have time allocated for writing notes and
> scheduling the next event at 20:00, and Weeknotes at 21:00.
>
> Monday the 21st is a Bank Holiday, so you will not be working.
>
> You will be working from the office on Thursday, the 24th.
>
> You are scheduled to be on call beginning Monday, the 28th of April through to
> Monday, the 5th of May.
>
> Is there anything else you require today, sir?

Will it be useful?  I don't know.  I think I just need to experiment with it a
bit.  I do like being warned a week in advance if I'm going to be on-call, that
was a good idea.  Adding a weather integration (like Stevens) could be handy.

In fact, when I asked Willikins what other data sources might be useful he gave
me some good suggestons:

> Sir, considering your current requirements, several additional data sources
> might prove beneficial:
>
> Email integration would allow me to monitor important correspondence and
> include relevant information in your briefings.
>
> Weather forecasts would enable me to advise you on appropriate attire or
> travel considerations.
>
> News feeds on topics of interest could keep you informed of relevant
> developments.
>
> A task management system would help track your priorities beyond calendar
> appointments.
>
> Public transport status updates might be valuable for office days.
>
> Would you like me to explore adding any of these data sources to enhance my
> service to you?

Working with an LLM has been interesting, I've not really found them that useful
before, but summarising text is obviously something they're really good at.
[Tool use][] is definitely a cool development in this space, and is what
underlies Willikins' memory and feed functionality.  Though, funnily enough,
when I first implemented a memory tool Willikins would usually not use it, I'd
tell him to remember something and he'd just say something like "certainly sir":
the solution to that was adding to the system prompt:

> Before responding to the user, use the create_memory tool to record any
> reminders or any other information that might be useful to reference later.

...but that made him overzealous, so I quickly followed that up with:

> You do not need to commit the calendar entries to memory.

It's still not quite right, but it's pretty close now.

I decided to write Willikins in Haskell, as I've not used it in so long.  It
took a few hours to get back into it, and the library ecosystem seems to be
worse than I remember (I got part way through implementing a PEM decoder before
I decided to authenticate with GCP (for the calendar) by just shelling out to
`gcloud`...), but I do find it fun to write.

### House Buying

Not much news this week, on Monday we got the replies to the questions we'd sent
to the seller's conveyancer, but it wasn't anything major.  Just waiting until
everyone's ready to agree on the date, now.
