I bought a house!


## Work

Still at [GoCardless][], for the fourth annual update in a row, though I suppose
this will be the last: the news has broken that [Mollie will be acquiring
GoCardless][gcm], so if I'm still around in a year's time it'll be my first year
at Mollie instead.  The deal doesn't actually complete until around mid 2026, so
nothing materially changes with my job until then.

One very welcome bit of news is that, a little while ago, the CEO announced that
we'd all have to be in the office three days a week from June 2026---a widely
unpopular decision that's contributed to many people leaving---and with the news
of the acquisition, that's been rolled back as we're going to adopt Mollie's
policy of leaving it up to individual teams instead.  I'm glad that the decision
has been changed (I was planning to leave if it didn't), but a bit put out that
it wasn't changed due to its unpopularity amongst existing staff, it was changed
due to money.

GoCardless opened a new office in Lisbon, and my team was the first to get moved
over, with new staff hired in Lisbon followed by a transition period of a few
months with the existing London staff being gradually rotated out to other
teams.  I got moved back to my original team.  I'm actually supposed to be on a
different team to lead a big project, but there have been some timing issues
which mean they won't actually be ready to start that until some time next year,
so this is just a temporary assignment.  It's nice to have a change, I'd been
doing dashboard stuff for so long.

## Finance

The big news this year is that I freed myself from the yoke of rent, by
attaching myself to the yoke of mortgage payments instead.

Every year, when it was time to renew my tenancy agreement, I would think
"should I just buy somewhere instead?", well, this year the choice was made for
me as the landlord decided to sell the flat.  Rather than find somewhere new to
rent and keep paying someone else's mortgage, I decided this was the time to
buy.

So I now have a nice two-bedroom house in Peterborough.  The commute to work is
about two hours, but I only need to go in one day a week.  I spent a few months
redecorating and furnishing the place, and it's now very nice.  Next year I'm
tackling the garden.  There are other projects too, but nothing urgent.

However, the downside is that the house deposit wiped out my investments (I put
down as large a deposit as I could, £125,000), and everything else took a big
chunk out of my cash savings.  But I've been rebuilding the cash savings this
year, and from next tax year I'll be filling my ISA again.  I'm also overpaying
the mortgage to clear that a little faster than the 20-year term I took out.

Something I often see in personal finance circles is that homeownership is more
expensive than renting, don't just assume you'll be saving loads more money by
buying a house!  This has always struck me as obvious nonsense as, putting aside
the costs associated with actually buying a house (stamp duty, legal fees, etc),
renting *obviously* has to cost more than buying as otherwise nobody would buy
houses to let them out as they wouldn't make a profit; rent has to have all the
mandatory costs (mortgage, repairs, insurance, the letting agent's cut, etc)
factored in.  And having done it myself now for around 6 months, I think it's
only more expensive because there's more stuff you can (but do not have to)
spend money on.  While I have spent more per-month than I did on my flat, it's
just because I would never have thought to throw away my money on getting a
rental flat painted, or to replace the aging carpet, or to make any of the other
small improvements that only add to the property's value and can't really be
taken with you.

Homeownership is more expensive because you *want* to improve the place.


## Reading

This year [bookdb][] hit **1000 books** (it's 1042 at the time of writing, and I
still need to add the books I got for Christmas), which is a pretty big
milestone.  I would have hit it long ago had I not started to prune my
collection in 2024.  There's less need of that now (I have much more space), but
there's still a limit to where you can sensibly fit bookcases in a house, so I
expect the absolute size of my collection to continue growing at a slower rate
than pre-2024, even if I still acquire new books at the same rate.

  - [The Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad) by Homer
  - [The Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) by Homer

My top three reads of 2025 are:

- **Ur of the Chaldees**

  This is the first---well, only---archaeology book I've read.  Sir Leonard
  Woolley tells the story of the excavations at Ur, and not only is it really
  interesting, it's also very entertaining.  It's not just a dry account of
  things dug up.

  It's full of story about how these people probably lived and what the finds
  were probably for; it's got many, many complaints about the last guy to
  excavate this place, who was from the cowboy era of just digging things up and
  sticking them in a museum, who had a habit of smashing through walls and
  damaging anything he judged boring; it's got really interesting tidbits about
  archaeological practices that I'd never considered before.  For example, at
  one point Woolley describes how they took a piece of jewellery out of the
  ground by pouring molten wax over it so they could lift out the whole thing
  without disturbing the relative arrangement of the components, to then be
  cleaned and studied later.

  And there's evidence of the flood, too.
  
- **The Wizard Knight**

  Wizard Knight is Gene Wolfe, which is really all that needs to be said to
  vouch for its quality---he's like Jack Vance, you just know if you see his
  name on the cover, it's an excellent (and confusing) book.  My copy has an
  introduction which I really appreciated as it primed me to pick up on some of
  the deeper meaning of the book, though it certainly didn't explain everything.

  Fundamentally, it's a coming-of-age story, told from the perspective of an
  American teenager, in a fantasy world with a heavy dose of Norse and Catholic
  theology sprinkled on top.  It's amazing really how well the two combine
  without anything like an awkward join in the middle, and how leaning the
  metaphysical underpinnings of the story really changes how you see things.
  
- **The Iliad**

  *I* knew the story of the Iliad, *everyone* knows the story of the Iliad!
  Eris throws the golden apple, which leads to Paris abducting Helen, and the
  war on Troy which ends with the wooden horse leading to the sack of Troy,
  wrapping up just in time for the Odyssey.  Everyone knows that!

  Actually no, turns out most of that is in other tales.  The Iliad proper just
  covers part of the war: not the beginning, not the end, it doesn't even have
  the horse!

  I picked up the Emily Wilson translation, which was excellent.  Very easy to
  read, the vocabulary and sentence structure didn't feel forced (always a risk
  when translating poetry into poetry), and just a good action-packed story.
  Often people think the classics are stuffy dry tomes, only for academics and
  the elite.  But this was pop culture back in its day!

No RPG book in the top three this year!  I've just been running Arden Vul all
year, so the RPG books I have read have only been for casual interest, not to
seriously bring to the table.  But I'm pretty confident there'll be an RPG book
here again for 2026.


## Tech

A pretty tame year for tech, really.

On the software side the only substantial change is dropping PuTTY as my Windows
SSH client of choice for [Tabby][], which has a much more sleek UI and handles
all my fonts (PuTTY refused to show most of them for some reason).  As part of
that I started using the [Uiua][] font, though my Uiua learning dropped off
pretty quickly.

Hardware is a bit more exciting as I rebuilt azathoth, my desktop machine, which
was last overhauled in 2020 with components that would have been cutting edge
in 2016.  I have tweaked it since then---more RAM, a new case---but it was
basically the same machine.  The straw that broke the camel's back was trying to
read an article about WebGL that had loads of examples, and it just couldn't
render the page.  So I'm now using an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D processor with a
Gigabyte AORUS MASTER ICE GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, and 96GB of RAM (with
space for two more sticks if I need them).  It's pretty good.

## Gaming

Most of this year's gaming was the weekly Arden Vul campaign on Sundays, today
we played session 124: that's 49 sessions out of 52 weeks!  There were a few one
shots too, and for a little while there was Troika on Fridays, but it's mostly
been Arden Vul.

The campaign, however, is finally coming to an end.  The players feel it's time
to bring it to a close.  Through a combination of magic items, the ability to
raise the dead, and alliances with powerful factions, there's not that much
challenge any more.  They can have most of the party die and shrug it off like
it was nothing, and also they’ve achieved most of their big goals.  Triv-Lok has
left, Kerbog Khan going with her.  The racial degradation of the Varumani has
been reversed.  Lankios healed.  The Cult of Set vanquished.  The Temple of
Thoth restored.  What’s left?

Just two things: completing the Trials of Arden, and leading a glorious crusade
against the Heqeti and their evil ziggurat at the base of the dungeon.  There
are more things we *could* do, like find all the regalia or move into the
political game, but those are the two things the players are most interested in.
We want to end on a dramatic finale, not drag it out with minutiae.

I expect the game will be over by April; but I had previously predicted the game
would be over by the end of this year (when they first got seriously into the
Trials and were completing two a week) and then they shifted focus and we're
only just entering the "pre-endgame" now.  The real endgame will begin when they
complete the 12th trial...

It'll be sad to leave Arden Vul behind, but it's been a lot of fun.

Our next campaign will be Ars Magica.
