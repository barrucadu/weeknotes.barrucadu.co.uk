## Books

This week I read:

- [Elric: The Sleeping Sorceress][] by Michael Moorcock

  This one was a bit strange, since only one of the stories in the collection is
  about Elric.  There's a short story version of *The Eternal Champion* (which
  really confused me since there's also a full book-sized version of that story,
  but it looks like a *Childhood's End* situation), but the single largest story
  is *The Sleeping Sorceress* which is about Elric and it returns to the
  sorceress which Earl Aubec met in the short story which introduced him.
  There's also shorter stories about Earl Aubec, Alexander the Great, a German
  albino magic sword wielder (who may be one of Elric's dream-manifestations),
  and a penis joke.
  
  The final story in the book, *The Flaneur des Arcades de l'Opera* stood out to
  me for two reasons.  Firstly, it's set in our real world, with secret
  departments of the UK and French governments working together against
  extraplanar threats, so there's this amusing juxtaposition of totally normal
  police talk with discussion of magic, souls, Law vs Chaos, and the multiverse;
  and also because there's this really cool depiction of the Cosmic Balance:
  
  > [Begg's] immediate instinct was to step back.  There below them, its blade
  > pointing down into the dancing, obscuring mist, he could see the shape of a
  > gigantic black sword fashioned to resemble a balance, with a cup depending
  > from each arm.  Within the metal of the black blade scarlet characters
  > writhed and twisted, the gleaming bejewelled cups moved slowly as they
  > measured the weight of the world's pain.  Multicolored strands of ectoplasm
  > swirled from the bowls.  Begg knew instinctively in his soul that once again
  > he did indeed look upon the legendary Cosmic Balance which regulated the
  > entire multiverse, weighing Law and Chaos, good and evil, truth and
  > falsehood, life and death, love and hate, maintaining the equilibrium, and
  > therefore the existence, of all created matter.
  
  Also, Hitler is involved, somehow.  In Moorcock's multiverse, Hitler was
  thwarted before the war, and turned to magical means...

- [The Haunting of Hill House][] by Shirley Jackson

  I saw this on the shelves in a book shop a little while back, and it just
  called to me.  The cover is nice and soft, the paper is good quality, and the
  edges are deckled, it *feels* like some old artefact.  Penguin really outdid
  themselves with this edition.
  
  The story is a true ghost story.  There are no monsters, very little is
  actually *seen*, and that which we do see is only from the perspective of one
  or two characters at a time.  The supernatural manifestations could plausibly
  be explained away as hallucinations---the effects of a weird house and tense
  atmosphere on the mind---or just coincidences which the characters give
  additional meaning due to the environment.  It felt like I was reading an
  M. R. James short story, who is the undoubted master of the genre.
  
  But there's also humour too.  I really liked the twist of two supernaturalists
  coming to the house a few days after the rest of the characters, with all
  their paraphernalia, and experiencing absolutely nothing conclusive despite
  everyone else being terrorised at night.  Was the house toying with them?
  Were they just unable to see what was happening before them?  Were there
  actually no supernatural manifestations and everyone else was acting strange?
  We just don't know.
  
  Great story, great writing, I couldn't put it down and read the whole thing
  over one afternoon.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week the players continued their delve deep into the Halls, finding two
more significant locations (the Inn of the Lost and the Arena), a safe haven
inside the dungeon where they can rest and gain XP (the Inn), and learning a
little more about the factions and their relationships.  They know that the
goblins hate the beastmen and have an uneasy friendship with the trolls, that
the trolls like stomping on everyone, and that there are Set cultists running
around.

The players are now really starting to hurt for money.  Everything down in the
Halls is expensive, but they've been spending almost all the treasure they find
immediately on carousing (for additional XP) or on equipment.  They're not broke
yet, but they will be if they don't make a good find soon.  And so we ended the
session with them heading off in search of a "fancy tomb" they heard about
somewhere to the west of the Troll Lifts.


## Miscellaneous

It's hot!

![Indoor temperatures for the last 14 days.](notes/248/temperature.png)

The portable AC unit I've got in my bedroom is better than nothing, though as
you can see not by much.  Sitting in the stream of cool air is nice, but it's
actually not that effective for cooling the bedroom as a whole, even with the
door shut and the gap beneath blocked to prevent a draft.  And then when the
unit is switched back off, the temperature quickly shoots back up.

My sleep has been terrible this week too, I've averaged 2 to 4 hours a night.
Oh well, only 3 months to go before we get back to a tolerable temperature.
