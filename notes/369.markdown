## Books

This week I read:

- The [Dolmenwood Monster Book][] from Necrotic Gnome

  It's a book of monsters, what more is there to say?

The ALIEN Evolved Edition kickstarter arrived this week:

### The Halls of Arden Vul

Pretty eventul session this week.

Firstly, as this is the last session before Halloween (we play on Sundays) I
called this the "Halloween Special" and said all the goblins were wearing carved
pumpkins over their heads.

But, putting that aside, the players completed the 8th trial of Arden, and also
saved the legendary Forge of Zhorak from doppelgangers, just in the nick of
time.  As written, doppelgangers are there and planning to destroy it, but I
decided to give the players a chance to beat them to it.

I had the Survivors of the Stone (an NPC dwarven adventuring group) looking for
the Forge.  They had a map to it via teleporter but didn't know how to get back,
so they were wary of just going (but would do so as a last resort).  I had
determined in advance when doppelgangers would ambush them, steal the map, and
destroy the Forge.  Four days before the attack, the players decided to go talk
to those dwarven adventurers they'd heard were looking for the Forge.  There's a
PC dwarf so they shared intel.  On the day of the attack, the human member of
the Survivors of the Stone escaped (she fell down a 50ft gap and the
doppelgangers left her for dead), and came to the PCs for help.

The players had a rough plan to make teleporters between the Forge of Zhorak and
the Arden Cult level by (1) sending a spellcaster to Zhorak, (2) getting back
with a Bead of Escape, and (3) using the rudishva Fire Pits of Creation to make
a pair of linked teleporters.  So they *quickly* enacted that by sending an
invisible spellcaster to Zhorak to scout it out and learn the area well enough
to make the teleporter, then all rushed through and took out the doppelgangers
before they could destroy the Forge.

Next week we'll see if the players inadvertently release the fire elemental, or
trigger the iron golem defense mechanism, or get killed by the spectre of
Zhorak.

As this was the last session of November, allow me to recant my suggestion that
the players would complete the Trials of Arden this month.  They changed focus
and are well behind where I expected them to be---players, how can you predict
them?

### Ars Magica

The Dolmenwood books are great, but what I really want to run next is [Ars
Magica][].

I've put together most of a pitch for the next campaign, after we finish Arden
Vul.  Here's the intro:

> In Ars Magica you play a **magum** (male "magus", female "maga", plural
> "magi") who lives in a **covenant**, that is to say a castle (or whatnot) with
> a group of other magi (your fellow player characters), getting up to whatever
> they want really, while also being part of a Europe-spanning wizard community
> called the **Order of Hermes**.
>
> The ability to work magic is called **the Gift**, and while it conveys magical
> power, it is off-putting to people and animals.  To get around this, each
> magum has a **companion**, played by a different player, who is a non-Gifted
> but plot-significant character.  Finally, there are the everyday servants,
> farmers, labourers, and so on who make the covenant function: these are called
> grogs and should be treated as **expendable redshirts**.
>
> A campaign of Ars Magica, called a **saga**, often lasts **decades of game
> time**, with a single session covering anywhere from a few days (if in the
> middle of an adventure) to multiple years (if the magi are just working in
> their labs).  A typical adventure will feature at most one magum, possibly one
> or two companions, and a gaggle of grogs.
>
> The year is AD 1220: Henry III is King of England, Frederick II is Holy Roman
> Emperor, Honorius III is Pope, the Fifth Crusade is in full force, and Gothic
> architecture is in style at the time.

One of the players is visiting me in a couple of weeks, and I'm going to pitch
it to them then.
