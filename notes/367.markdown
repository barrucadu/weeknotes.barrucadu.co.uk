## Books

This week I read:

- The [Dolmenwood Player's Book][] from Necrotic Gnome

  I ran a Dolmenwood campaign a few years ago and it was a lot of fun, but that
  was back before there was a Dolmenwood *system*, it was still OSE with some
  house rules and new classes.  This is the first time I've really looked into
  the new (well, not so new, the draft version was released ages ago) system
  itself.  I like it a lot, it's very similar to OSE, just incorporating a lot
  of nice little tweaks from the previous Dolmenwood material and from the
  Carcass Crawler zines.  I could see using it as a base for non-Dolmenwood OSR
  games, too.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

Total deviation from the Trials of Arden this week: the players looted a tomb,
and then cleared out some earth-spirit things in the vicinity of where one
player wanted to set up a dwarven colony.  Now they're talking about going to
find a lost dwarven forge.  What happened to the trials!

We're still on track to the endgame, but my confidence in them completing the
trials this month is shaken.  Ah well, that just gives me more time to read up
on Ars Magica.


## Miscellaneous

I've been looking into [Uiua][], an array-oriented programming language, this
weekend.  It's kind of interesting, but it's very heavy on unicode which set me
on the path of a yak in need of shaving... you see, I run Windows on my desktop
machine, and have a permanent SSH session open to my home server for all my
Linux needs (for instance, I'm typing this weeknote right now via emacs running
on the server).

I used the venerable [PuTTY][] for SSH, but upon trying Uiua I hit a snag: my
default font didn't have all the required unicode characters.  No problem, I
thought, Uiua provides a font.  I'll just install and use that.  Well, for
whatever reason, PuTTY wouldn't let me choose it.  The font selection in Putty
is very abbreviated in fact, with only a fraction of my installed fonts
available.

So that, plus PuTTY's general clunkiness, led me to finally look for an
alternative Windows SSH tool.  After some (very little) research, I settled on
[Tabby][], which does work with all my fonts and is quite nice to use.  I keep
falling afoul of keybindings that clash with my emacs ones, but it's getting
there, and it does feel a lot nicer than PuTTY ever did.
