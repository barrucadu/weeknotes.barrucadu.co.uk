Another year has gone by, making it time for the Big Weeknote once again.

## Work

I'm still working for [GoCardless][], but early this year I got promoted to
Senior Developer.

This was very timely as it was approaching the two-year mark since I joined, and
I was planning to start looking for a new (and more highly paid) job if a
promotion didn't seem imminent: so well done GoCardless, you kept hold of me!
The next step up from Senior to Principal is a big one so I think I'll be in
this role for a while, but it's fairly well paid (and better than the offers I
get spammed with on Linkedin) so I'm happy for the time being.

I changed teams as part of that and I'm now on a much more merchant-facing team,
whereas before I was largely working on the internals consumed by other teams.
So there's been an adjustment, but it's nice to get to learn different areas of
the codebase and different parts of the business.

I'm currently leading development of a long sought-after feature that we're
planning to launch in the near future (we've got some beta testers using it
already).  I won't go into detail now, but it's technically interesting and has
involved a lot of fairly fundamental internal changes, breaking assumptions that
have been in place from the beginning, which is a fun challenge to navigate.

Also this year the last project I led on my previous team got launched.  Our
internal payouts process used to run at 11:00 UK time (this isn't a secret, it's
[in the documentation][] and it's also when merchants get the majority of their
webhooks) but now it's fully localised: meaning the pipeline can be scheduled in
the local time of the destination currency.  This means payouts can be submitted
to the banks based on local scheme cutoff times (without needing to manually
adjust the pipeline time as, say, Australian time deviates from UK time across
the year) which means merchants receive their money a day faster, for some
currencies.

This wasn't just a matter of updating a crontab, there's a lot of time and date
logic in the pipeline and in related jobs that we had to review and change.

The rollout happened while I was on holiday in Japan so sadly I didn't get to
press the metaphorical big red button, but it went off without a
hitch---Australian payouts are now localised to Sydney time---and the groundwork
laid for ongoing improvements to payout speed.

## Finance

Another year of gradual progress: consistency, that's the key.

Though this has been an expensive year in some respects.  I had my three-week
holiday in Japan (which I largely saved up for in 2023, but then spent all the
money this year), and more recently I've spent £1340 on dental care as I
*finally* started seeing a dentist again after a gap of several years and had to
have a bunch of work done.

Given those extra expenses, my FIRE number has gone up significantly this year,
and my "runway"---how long it'd take to run out of money if I quit my job right
now and just lived off the current cash and investments, at today’s market
value, with no lifestyle changes at all---is still a little below 5 years, the
same as this time last year.

But with next year's forecasted expenses, those numbers improve significantly.

I plan to make two changes in 2025:

- I want to increase my cash savings a bit, particularly for healthcare, as my
  existing health budget of £200 (enough to cover sundries like toothpaste,
  mouthwash, the occasional pills for headache or hayfever, etc) was woefully
  inadequate.

- I also want to build a small emergency fund for other surprises that aren't
  covered by (or significantly exceed) an existing budget category.

I used to have an emergency fund, but [I ditched it in 2021][ef].  Part of the
reason I got rid of it was so I could invest that cash, but my income now is
such that building an emergency fund won't prevent me from using up my whole ISA
allowance, so saving that extra cash (rather than pumping it straight into a GIA
or a SIPP) is an acceptable tradeoff.

## Reading

This year I read 92 books, significantly up from last year, though a bunch of
that was manga which is much quicker to get through.  The number doesn't really
matter.

I'm also up to 998 books in bookdb, with 2 more arriving in the next few days!
Wow, 1000 books!  This year saw some expansion of my (still small) nonfiction
section, as well as a lot of books (mostly fiction) being thrown out due to
space considerations.  I don't much like getting rid of a book, but there were
some that I was just never going to read, and space is at a premium.

This year I also [got rid of the percentage-read stat from bookdb][numread], as
it made me feel bad about not reading reference books cover-to-cover (and hence
being "unread" forever).

Here's what I read:

My top three reads of 2024 are:

- **Frieren**

  Ok, ok, this is a series, which is a bit of a cheat.  But it's just so good I
  would be remiss not to include it.  The eponymous Frieren is a
  thousand-year-old elven mage, the story is set after her and her adventuring
  party completed their 10-year quest to defeat the dark lord and save the
  world.  The defining event of a lifetime for some; a short errand for Frieren.
  The story touches on the passage of time, loss, and how sometimes you only
  realise you didn't spend enough time with someone until it's too late.

  There is also a fantastic anime adaptation (with a great soundtrack) which
  covers up to part way through volume 7, and I hope there'll be more.
  
- **Lyonesse**

  I'd previously read Jack Vance's *Tales of the Dying Earth* and knew
  *Lyonesse* was considered right up there in terms of quality, and it is.  It
  may not be that well-known now, but at least in the sphere of fantasy
  roleplaying games it's one of the major influential works.  It's very
  Arthurian, explicitly so (the round table of the kings of Lyonesse is noted to
  serve as the inspiration for King Arthur's table), and very fairytale.
  
  It would make great game material as while there is a "main quest" throughout
  the whole work, things also just happen to major characters and waylay them
  for years at a time as they're trapped inside a fairy forest, or need to save
  some child slaves from an ogre, or whatever.
  
  Fun fact: [Lyonesse is a "real" mythological sunken island][atlantis]!
  
- **Delta Green: The Conspiracy**

  This sourcebook for the '90s has totally changed the next campaign I want to
  run.  I was planning some King in Yellow-esque horror based on the *Impossible
  Landscapes* campaign but it was looking like quite a lot of work, as I really
  dislike the latter half of *Impossible Landscapes* so I was changing
  everything.  Also, *Impossible Landscapes* is a bit of an atypical campaign
  that plays with free will and apparently works best with players already
  somewhat familiar with your typical Delta Green campaign, which mine aren't.
  So the more I got into it, the more it seemed like not a great fit.
  
  Reading *The Conspiracy* inspired me to run a much more traditional campaign
  focussing on UFOs and the fight against MAJESTIC and the Greys.  I have [a
  rough outline planned][nextgame], and will flesh it out some more before we
  start.

## Tech

This year I [finally gave up the pretence that I dual-boot azathoth][azathoth],
and removed the NixOS drive.  I'm now fully on Windows 11 for desktop computing:
much of what I do is done through a web browser (which is OS independent) or a
terminal (which I get by SSHing into nyarlathotep or carcosa), and games and
media make up a large portion of the rest, which just work better on Windows.

2024 was not the Year of the Linux Desktop.

Other than that:

- I migrated all my static sites from docker-based build scripts to Nix flakes.
  Having the custom pre-built docker image doesn't actually save that much time
  compared to Nix just fetching all the dependencies on build, and adds
  significant complexity.

- A lightbulb went on inside my head and I realised I could use
  [barrucadu.co.uk][] for more than a boring portfolio, so it's now much more
  fun.

- I [swapped out][ps2vm] [promscale][] for [VictoriaMetrics][] for my personal
  finance dashboard.  Unfortunately support for promscale was discontinued in
  2023, and it had developed an annoying habit of losing data, so I had no
  choice to move.

- I rewrote [bookdb][bookdbrs] and [bookmarks][bookmarksrs] again, in Rust this
  time (and then later did a couple of smaller rewrites changing the web stack
  from [actix-web][] to [axum][]).  Now they're entirely self-contained binaries
  that don't need template files or any other resources to function; just the
  system libraries and an elasticsearch instance.

- I [switched from][rtf2ts] [rtorrent][] & [flood][] to [transmission][].  I've
  used rtorrent for many years and like it a lot, but it was really starting to
  struggle with the number of torrents, there was some issue where the XMLRPC
  socket would break after a few hours and so I couldn't control it without
  restarting the process.

- I [geodistributed my static sites between Europe and the US][geo].  This was a
  pretty cool little project, you should go read the blog post.

- I [switched from][dp2rs] [duplicity][] to [restic][] for backups (and moved
  files from AWS S3 to Backblaze B2 while I was at it).  This is significantly
  cheaper, and much easier to use: I actually have confidence that restoring
  arbitrarily-old backups works now (because I've tried it).

But otherwise things are pretty much the same.  [NixOS][] is still great for
servers (and for desktops too, it's just more convenient to not dual-boot),
[Emacs][] is a great text editor, [Firefox][] a great web browser, and
[Obsidian][] a great note-taking tool.

I might put [a "uses" page][uses] up on barrucadu.co.uk...

No big plans for next year, though I've hit a point where I can't upgrade
Windows on azathoth any more due to the motherboard being too old (it doesn't
have a TPM), so I *might* rebuild azathoth but I'm not totally sure as it still
works just fine.

## Gaming

This year I fully drifted away from my Saturday group, [a process which began
last year](notes/276.html#gaming).  The straw that broke the camel's back was a
very long hiatus (caused by the primary GM having to leave the group) combined
with a succession of games that just didn't interest me.

- **Sunday Group**
  - **Run:** Old School Essentials, The One Ring, Black Sword Hack (one-shot), RuneQuest (one-shot), ALIEN (one-shot)
  - **Played:** Troika, Ironsworn: Starforged

  Somewhat confusingly, this group now has a regular Friday game too: one of the
  original players, long absent due to life changes, finally had time to commit
  to a game again, but can only do Friday evenings.  So we've got two campaigns
  going with a large overlap in people.

  Our first Friday game was Ironsworn: Starforged, a co-operative GMless game.
  While I like the idea of Ironsworn (and the [Me, Myself and
  Die!](https://www.youtube.com/@MeMyselfandDieRPG) Ironsworn series is great)
  we just didn't really get on with it and quit it after a few sessions.

  After Ironsworn I ran a short campaign of The One Ring, which was great fun
  and does a really good job of feeling like you're in The Hobbit or The Lord of
  the Rings.  The mechanics produce Tolkien-esque stories, which is exactly what
  you want from a themed system.

  Then finally the returnee started a Troika campaign, something they've been
  saying they'd do for years.  It's quite fun, I do get bored easily as a player
  but Troika is pretty wacky so I get around that by just playing an impulsive
  character who'll kick open the door, put on the magic hat, or otherwise
  interact with the obviously-interactable thing in the scene.  This is the
  first campaign he's run, too, so I think it helps if I do the obvious thing
  he's signalling.

  The Arden Vul campaign on Sunday is still going strong, we hit session 75 this
  weekend and while the players have definitely done a lot, they're still very,
  *very*, far from completing the dungeon, if such a thing is even possible.  We
  will just have to bring it to an end at some point to play the next thing, but
  that's far in the future.

- **Ended: Arden Vulgaris**
  - **Played:** Shadowdark

  I had a rare opportunity to join an open-table game of Arden Vul *as a
  player*, which I leapt at after confirming with the GM that me knowing all the
  secrets is fine.  To be honest I wasn't really sure how this would go: I would
  be taking a backseat role a lot of the time, and I know I get kind of bored as
  a player.  But on the other hand, Arden Vul is incredible and the opportunity
  to see how another GM tackles it invaluable.  So I optimistically signed up.

  Ultimately I faded away after a couple of months, though I still kept up with
  what was going on, and the campaign ended very dramatically.  Glad I tried it,
  but once my first cool character died a lot of the fun died with him.

- **Ended: Pathfinder Group**
  - **Played:** Pathfinder 2e

  Towards the end of 2023 I recruited a new player for the Sunday group from
  Reddit (they ended up leaving due to stylistic differences), and while they
  were with us they started a side-game of Pathfinder on Friday evenings.
  Pathfinder's not really my thing, but I went along with it and had an ok time.

  Unfortunately, the group fell apart rather explosively when we ended the first
  campaign and the GM was preparing the next: I made a character and the GM was,
  from my point of view, very picky about how I'd built the character to the
  point of accusing me of intentionally gimping the party and told me he
  wouldn't accept it.  I knew my character wasn't *optimal*, but they didn't
  seem so bad to me.  I was unwilling to change, we had a big argument, I quit
  the group and left the Discord.  Then over the next few days everyone else
  quit as they took sides in this argument.

  I do feel a bit bad for the GM, as they'd just spent a load of money on a big
  Foundry module to run the campaign, but... they should have been willing to
  allow a slightly suboptimal character which nobody else thought would be a
  problem (admittedly I have mixed feelings on this because, as a GM, I know
  it's important to be able to rule out problematic characters).

## Akkadian

This year I decided to take my casual interest in the Ancient Near East to the
next level by [learning Akkadian][akk].  I've been doing that for a few months
now, and have translated [the complaint tablet to Ea-Nāṣir][eanasir] and [The
Descent of Ištar into the Netherworld][ishtar].

It's a lot of fun, and very satisfying.  I'm at the point now where---armed with
a dictionary and grammar reference---I can translate reasonably well from
transliterated texts.  I've had less success at learning vocabulary: I tried to
use [Anki][] for about a month and a half but dropped it as I wasn't retaining
any of the verbs (though nouns and adjectives were fine).

Since Akkadian is a dead language, the ability to quickly recall vocabulary
isn't so important, though, as I won't need to be able to speak it, to write it,
or to read anything that needs an immediate translation.  Still, it would be
nice to be able to do that, if only in principle.

I haven't tackled the script (cuneiform) yet.  That's going to be my next
project (along with furthering my grammatical knowledge by continuing to work
through the textbooks I have), and in 2025 I'd like to translate a long piece of
cuneiform text.

## Japan Trip

I spent just over two weeks from mid-April to early-May in Japan with a bunch of
online friends from a small imageboard, none of whom I'd met in person before.
I had a really great time!

I had direct flights there and back between Heathrow and Haneda, unlike last
time I went to Japan to attend a small conference during my Ph.D (which didn't
give me much opportunity to look around), so these were the longest flights I've
been on by far.  Still, not so bad, I just kind of zoned out after a while and
time ceased to exist.

We spent a few days in Tokyo while everyone recovered from jetlag, then a week
in Osaka, and the final week back in Tokyo.  I also spent a weekend meeting up
with some other friends in Matsuyama.

While the language was obviously a difficulty, I was very impressed with how
good Google Lens was at translating signs, menus, and any other written text I
pointed it at.  Sometimes it got things wrong, but it was close enough that I
could get by.

I paused weeknotes during the trip, and wrote [a single long weeknote with some
summarising thoughts][292] once I got home.

## King James Programming

This year I resurrected [King James Programming][], a tumblr blog that posts
once a day the curated output of a Markov chain trained on the King James Bible
and the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  I also set it up [on
the Fediverse][].

I rewrote the generator code to make the output easier to visually scan for the
crossover points where it switches from one corpus to the other, as those are
where the fun bits are, but it's still quite a lot of tedious work.  So unless I
am suddenly struck by a desire to do more, KJP will end on the 28th of February.
I've picked out a quote that has a degree of finality to it to be the last one.

## Miscellaneous

Another notable thing that happened this year was my first trip to A&E: I
slipped and cut my left index finger badly in late November.

I'm pleased to say that while it's still not 100% it's healing quite well.
There's a faint scar and I very nearly have full movement back.  The more
concerning thing is the near total loss of feeling on the side of the cut,
between the cut and the fingertip.  That might just be gone forever, or it might
come back in several months time.  Impossible to say.

Be careful with knives.
