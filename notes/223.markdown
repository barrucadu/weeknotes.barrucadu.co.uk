Merry Christmas!  The end of the year is upon us once more!


## Work

This year I changed jobs.  After after 4 years at [GDS][], I moved to
[GoCardless][].

Over 2021 I started to feel like I needed a change.  I'd been doing the same
sort of thing for a while and, even if I changed teams, I'd still be doing
something fairly similar.  I wanted to work on larger and more complex systems,
and I didn't want to have my career advancement contingent upon doing more line
management.

So I started looking around.  I sent a total of 8 applications, of which 2 never
responded, 5 rejected me before an interview, and 1 rejected me after an
interview.

Then after all that work of tracking down and applying to interesting-sounding
companies (I don't just want *a* job, I want an *interesting* job), a GoCardless
recruiter reached out to me over linkedin and that's how I ended up at the new
place.

I've been there for 9 months now, working on a team which owns a lot of the core
logic and data which powers our payment processing.  Right off the bat I was
thrust into complex scalability work, so we could handle millions more payments
a day than we currently processed, and it's been a lot of fun.

It also pays more, which is nice.

## Finance

As interesting as my job may be, it is still an unwanted imposition upon my
life, an evil necessary to survive in our modern society.  Were I financially
independent, I would drop it in a heartbeat.

So, finances.

This year I didn't really make any changes to my practices.  I changed some
account names up to make budgeting easier, but that's it.  I'm pretty happy with
how I model things now, and don't see myself making any big changes next year
either.

I'm closer to financial independence (FIRE) than I was at the start of the year,
but there's still a long way to go.

Firstly, I'm now saving / investing over 50% of my net income.  This is, really,
the bare minimum to achieve FIRE, as it'll let me FIRE in about 16 years.  The
next milestone I'm aiming for is 66%, which would let me FIRE in about 10 years;
I'll need to increase my income further to have a chance of hitting that,
though.

Secondly, my "runway"---how long it would take to run out of cash if I quit my
job this second, sold all my investments, and didn't change my spending habits
one bit---is now 3 years.  That's a long time to not need to work!  But I
shouldn't relax now and actually quit my job for an extended break, that'd just
eat up my savings and delay the goal of *permanent* retirement.

Knowing I'll be working for 16 more years, at least, isn't very encouraging.
Likely longer, if inflation remains so high and wages don't keep up.  That's
half a lifetime away!  But it's better than working an *entire* lifetime.


## Reading

This year I read 62 books, which is nothing to sniff at---it's, on average, just
over one book a week---but looking at what I *actually* read, it's only that
high because I read a lot of light novels.  If we look at non-light-novel prose
fiction specifically, which used to be the bulk of my reading, I read a mere
*17* books this year!  There were 15 weeks in which I didn't finish any books at
all!

Despite having so many books, quite often I felt as if I had nothing to read.
No more big series I'd been meaning to get into.  Just lots of individual books,
some of which I'm really not that keen to read, and which have been sitting
around unopened on my shelves for years.  I should probably get rid of them.
I've also not bought much new fiction this year (if you don't count the light
novels), but that's partly because there's not been much I've wanted to read.

I think I need to discover some new authors.  Time to go hit up an actual
physical book shop and see what's recent.

All that said, here's what I read this year:

  - [The Chronicles of Amber]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber) by Roger Zelazny

My top three books read in 2022 are:

- **The Goblin Emperor**

  This was a pleasant discovery, and definitely the sort of thing I want more
  of.  I'd seen it mentioned on the [Fantasy subreddit][] many times, and then
  one day picked it up on a whim, and could hardly put it down until I finished
  it only a couple of days later.
  
  It's politics-focussed, pretty fast-paced, and manages to present an
  interesting world in a way that feels natural and without needing lore dumps.
  The one failing, as I mentioned in earlier comments, is that I don't believe
  the events of the book actually happened in the timeframe the book said they
  did.  I haven't re-read the book and counted the days to check, but it just
  doesn't feel right; and if everything *does* fit, it kind of lowers the
  significance of some of the difficulties the protagonist faces if they were
  resolved so quickly.
  
- **The Chronicles of Amber**

  This is perhaps cheating slightly, as it's five books in one volume, so surely
  it's five times as good as a comparable-length fantasy novel should be.  But
  putting that aside...
  
  This is *definitely* old-school fantasy.  The central tension is order
  (represented by the City of Amber) vs chaos (represented by the Courts of
  Chaos).  All the worlds of the multiverse are mere shadows of Amber and the
  Courts created by their inhabitants as they flit from one to another in search
  of their perfect worlds.  There's a lot left unexplained in this, probably the
  major thing is just who the residents of the Courts are and where they came
  from.  Amber was created from chaos, but whence chaos?
  
  The Second Chronicles is on my book list, and I'm looking forward to learning
  more.
  
- **Old School Essentials: Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome**

  Last year, I picked the Traveller core rulebook as one of my top books, from
  all the hours of fun it had given me.  Considering that, it seems only fair to
  give the OSE Player's Tome the same honour.
  
  I like the OSR aesthetic.  I follow several OSR blogs.  I've bought OSR
  adventures, sourcebooks, and zines.  I've backed a bunch of OSR kickstarters.
  But frankly, I had difficulty finding an OSR *system* that I liked enough to
  use for a campaign.  Or really *any* fantasy system I liked enough to use for
  a campaign.  So I went back to basics: B/X D&D plus a smattering of AD&D,
  nicely presented in the form of Old School Essentials.  And it's pretty great.
  D&D-style fantasy is exactly the sort of fantasy I like to run.
  
  It turns out I'm one of those weirdos who got their start with more narrative
  RPGs (the first game I ever played was Dungeon World), decided "screw this, I
  want verisimilitude, not storytelling", moved to traditional RPGs, and then to
  the *most traditional* of them all.

## Tech

It's been a year of changes, but few radical changes, just iterative
improvements.

In October I moved these weeknotes from [memo.barrucadu.co.uk][] to this domain.
I wrote about why I did that at the time, so [go read that][].

I've continued tweaking how I run my computers.  I...

- Migrated my [NixOS config][] to [flakes][]
- Encrypted my secrets with [sops-nix][]
- Moved my [backup scripts][] completely into my NixOS config
- Switched from some home-grown monitoring scripts to [Alertmanager][]

I also started using some new software and stopped using some old software:

- Stopped self-hosting [Gitea][] and migrated everything to GitHub (it's just
  easier)
- Switched my [dotfiles][] from [GNU Stow][] to [chezmoi][], so I could more
  easily have per-machine differences
- Simplified my home-grown emacs config by switching to one based on
  [doom-emacs][]

The biggest change is that I dropped [Pi-hole][] when my Raspberry Pi stopped
working, and wrote my own [recursive DNS resolver with adblocking][], which has
been powering my LAN DNS [since mid March][].  It was a cool project which
taught me that DNS is, in fact, fairly simple.

## Gaming

This was a good year for gaming.

### Computer Games

I mostly play roleplaying games these days, when I pick up a computer game I
tend to get really into it for a few weeks, then burn myself out and never touch
it again.  But in those few weeks it's really fun!  This year I've particularly
enjoyed:

- **Dyson Sphere Program**

  I just like setting up production lines.  But, at least when I played the
  game, there wasn't really an end goal beyond "build a dyson sphere".  Which I
  did.  And the moment I achieved that difficult and fun goal, the game lost all
  meaning and I couldn't even muster up the motivation to start anew with a
  different approach, since I'd just be working towards something I'd already
  achieved once before.
  
  I have that problem with these sorts of games a lot.

- **Cult of the Lamb**

  I liked the cutesy / culty mix of this game, and the roguelite gameplay was
  fun and engaging.  I got up to the final boss battle, but found it just a bit
  too bullet-hell for me so I've kind of stalled there.

- **Crusader Kings 3**

  Not a new game, but one I only really figured out to competently play this
  year after reading Brett Devereaux's series on [what sort of history the game
  models][], which helped me to understand some of the mistakes I'd been making,
  and got me itching to play again.

- **Victoria 3**

  Another Paradox grand strategy game, though of a different bent to CK3.  I've
  not played much of this yet, only the tutorial, but that was fun and I think I
  just need to give it a proper go.

- **Dwarf Fortress**

  I like colony-sim games.  I've put a lot of hours into Banished and Patron,
  and I'm no stranger to Dwarf Fortress.  It's the ultimate.  The ideal
  colony-sim.  But it's *just so daunting!*
  
  Until now, that is.  The Steam release is out, with a GUI (!) and a general
  reorganisation of things to make the game possible to pick up without inhaling
  the entire wiki up-front.  Finally, I've managed to do more than just the
  quickstart gudie, and had a fairly successful fortress of around a hundred
  dwarves.  It did get up to close to 200 at one point, which was causing issues
  with the food supply, but I exiled all the unhappy dwarves and lowered the
  population cap for a few years while I built things up.
  
  The only thing is... the game seems not very difficult actually?  Before I
  intentionally tunneled into the underworld and lost the fort to demons, my
  militia was pretty good and could easily take down Forgotten Beasts and
  Titans.  To defend against sieges (not that any happened), I could just raise
  my drawbridge.  I was totally self-sufficient, I just ignored the trade
  caravan when it came.  And even when I *did* tunnel into the underworld, only
  two demons came out!  A far cry from the "hundreds" the wiki says.  However,
  two were enough.
  
  I think my next fort needs to be somewhere more exciting where there's
  actually an external threat I have to defend against.  Maybe I should embark
  on a haunted glacier.

### Roleplaying Games

Another good year for roleplaying games.  I've played 8 systems and run another
5 (unless I've forgotten some we just used for a one-shot or something), with a
total of 20 people across 4 groups:

- **Tuesday Group**
 
  - **Run:** Ars Magica
  - **Played:** Eclipse Phase, Castaway (one-shot)

  Unfortunately, I ended up leaving this group back in March.  After I finished
  running the Ars Magica campaign, someone else started an Eclipse Phase
  campaign but ultimately we decided nobody was really into it, and so I bowed
  out when they decided to start a new campaign of D&D 5e (since I was already
  in two other D&D-like games at the time).

- **Work Group**

  - **Run:** Old School Essentials

  I started this group after some not-very-subtle hints that a bunch of people
  really wanted to play D&D but nobody was willing to run a campaign.  So I
  started a fortnightly game with 6 players that was supposed to be easy for
  people to drop in and out of, since I didn't expect attendance to be very good
  for an after-work game.

  Unfortunately, attendance was even worse than I expected, and after several
  frustrating instances of cancelling due to only 1 (or 0!) players being
  available, I decided to drop the campaign and we're going to regroup in
  January to see who wants to play *and can commit*.

- **Saturday Group**

  - **Run:** Old School Essentials, Traveller (one-shot)
  - **Played:** Ecopunk 2044, Monster of the Week, Simple World, Stars Without Number

  My first group, still going strong.
  
  We did go through a rough patch where a bunch of sessions got postponed or
  skipped on short notice, but we solved that by switching to a more open
  schedule: when you have the next session of your campaign prepared, you can
  claim the next available Saturday on the list, and you can't claim more than
  one Saturday in advance.  Ostensibly, we're now playing four campaigns, but in
  practice it's just mine and one other alternating weekly, with one of the
  other two GMs occasionally running a single session of their campaigns.

- **Sunday Group**

  - **Run:** Forbidden Lands (one-shot), Traveller, Wicked Ones
  - **Played:** Genesys (one-shot), Whitehack

  My second group, also going fairly strong.  This year one player dropped out,
  and we haven't managed to get a replacement yet.  Though, recently, a friend
  has been listening into our sessions.  But we've not managed to convince her
  to actually join in as a player yet.
  
  It used to be me and another GM alternating games, but the other GM had to
  take a break so it's just been me for a while.  She doesn't seem to have any
  plans to start a new campaign soon, so I guess it's just me running weekly
  games for the foreseeable future, which is fine by me.

Right now I'm running two campaigns:

- An OSE [Dolmenwood][] hexcrawl for my Saturday group, in which the players are
  cartographers charged to map out the forest and learn its secrets.  Which
  really is just a good excuse for them to wander around and get into
  adventures.  Dolmenwood is a really great setting, it's not just your standard
  D&D-flavour fantasy, it's really evocative, weird, and fairytale-like.  And
  the books are just so well-written and easy to use, I barely need to prepare
  anything beyond finding or reskinning the occasional dungeon to drop in at a
  convenient location.

- A Traveller "Milieu 0" campaign for my Sunday group, in which the players are
  private contractors doing scouting and surveying work of systems which haven't
  been visited since the collapse of interstellar civilisation some 1,500 years
  ago.  All set against an exciting backdrop of the formation of the Third
  Imperium and the interstellar power-shakeup that results.  We only just
  started this a few weeks ago, and have got through the first adventure (a
  murder mystery in which they had to prove their innocence), and will be
  picking this up again on the 8th of January with a survey mission.

I really like both OSE and Traveller.  They and Call of Cthulhu are definitely
up there as my favourite systems.

Of the other systems I've run this year:

- Ars Magica was just too complicated.  I feel you'd need to basically study the
  rulebook to be able to run or play it without needing to constantly look
  things up.

- Forbidden Lands didn't click for me.  I didn't like the hexcrawling or
  stronghold rules, which are basically the only reasons you'd use it over
  another fantasy system.

- Wicked Ones just wasn't really my thing.  Too narrative, actually challenging
  the players (without just deciding up front that they were going to lose) was
  really difficult.

Still, I don't regret trying any of them.

Finally, this year, I switched from [Roll20][] to [Foundry][].  It felt a bit
silly paying $9.99/month to Roll20 to get... frankly, not very much.  I'd used
Foundry as a player a fair bit, so I decided to take the plunge and try it out
as a GM.  It worked very well, and I'm now happily self-hosting it.

## Miscellaneous

I got back into baking bread this year.  I kind of fell out of the habit when
flour first became unavailable in 2020, but now I'm making nice loaves of
sourdough every week or so.  Also, I do sourdough now, previously I used instant
yeast.

Here's my recipe.

### Starter

1. Mix half cup rye flour and half cup water in a glass jar, lightly cover with
   a tea towel and leave at room temperature for 24 hours.
2. Discard half the mixture, mix in another half cup rye flour and quarter cup
   water, re-cover and leave for another 24 hours.
3. Repeat step 2 for 4 days.

### Sourdough

1. **Prepare dough:**
   1. Mix 6 cups bread flour with 2 cups water, 2.5tsp salt, and half cup
      starter.
   2. Lightly cover dough with a tea towel and leave at room temperature
      overnight.
2. **Proof:**
   1. Move dough onto a lightly floured tea towel, and shape into a tight ball.
   2. Leave dough-ball at room temperature for 2 hours.
3. Pre-heat oven to 200C with a dutch oven (or cast iron pan) (with lid) inside.
4. **Bake:**
   1. Move dough ball from tea towel into hot dutch oven (with lid), and bake
      for 45 minutes.
   2. Remove lid and continue to bake until golden brown (10 to 15 minutes).
   3. Remove bread from dutch oven and leave to cool.

If your kitchen is cold, for the proofing step you can fill the sink with warm
water, put the tea towel-wrapped dough-ball in a bowl, and float the bowl in the
sink.
