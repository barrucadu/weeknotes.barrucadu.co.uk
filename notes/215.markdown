![The Haul](notes/215/haul.jpg)

This month's haul of RPG books has all arrived: mostly OSR, a book of fictional
mushrooms, and one Call of Cthulhu scenario.  I also picked up a bunch of PDFs
from the DriveThruRPG Halloween sale.  I've got:

- **Rakham Vale**[^rv], a kind of fairytale fantasy setting inspired by the art
  of [Arthur Rackham][].  I *might* put this south of Dolmenwood in my current
  campaign, though we've still got a lot of Dolmenwood to go (and the campaign
  is specifically about mapping Dolmenwood, not just random adventuring in the
  region) so maybe that'll feature in a future campaign.

- **Fungi of the Far Realms**[^ffr], a system-neutral supplement all about
  fictional mushrooms.  This is by the Melsonian Arts Council, the creators of
  [Troika][], so I've had my eye on it for a while.  No idea what I'll use it
  for yet, but it's certainly a very nice book, physically: hardback covers with
  bookcloth, a sewn binding, and nice thick paper.  The only letdown is that,
  despite the sewn binding, it doesn't lay completely flat, maybe it just needs
  breaking in a bit.

- **Longwinter**[^l], a fantasy setting and adventure by [Luka Rejec][], creator
  of Ultraviolet Grasslands and many other adventures.  It's a charming generic
  European alpine setting with winter approaching... and then the horrifying
  winter spirit who wants that winter *to never end*.  There are two books, a
  guidebook for the players and a setting book for the referee, which is an
  approach I quite like.

- **The Stygian Library**[^sl], a depthcrawl by [Emmy Allen][], creator of The
  Gardens of Ynn.  It's a neat little adventure where the referee rolls up
  locations (made up of a room, feature, and encounter), with the rolls modified
  by how deep into the library the party is.  The goal is to delve into the
  depths and find some information, but the library gets more weird and
  dangerous the further you go.

- **Where the Wheat Grows Tall**[^wtwgt], a Slavic fairytale adventure, which
  isn't something I'm very familiar with.  If nothing else, it's nice seeing
  characters with names other than "made up Anglosphere or maybe Roman".  I read
  through it on the train today, I think I might be able to fit into one of my
  current campaigns (e.g., maybe the farm is inside Fairy (unbeknownst to the
  inhabitants) and can be reached from Dolmenwood).  I'm a little unsure as to
  how to actually run the adventure though, we're given this setting and a bunch
  of things in it, but not much guidance on how it should actually play out.
  I'll have to read through it again and think.

- **Witchburner**[^w], another adventure by Luka Rejec.  This is about hunting
  down a witch who has been ruining crops and spoiling milk and whatnot with
  their fell powers... but the twist is that *there's actually no witch*.  The
  players will end up in this difficult situation where the highly superstitious
  townsfolk demand a witch to burn, perhaps even attacking and attempting to
  burn the player characters themselves if they fail to produce one.  I'm
  tempted to run this on an isolated backwater planet in my future Traveller
  campaign, which is a setting without magic *at all*, which will give it an
  interesting thematic twist.

- **Viral**[^v], a modern-day Call of Cthulhu scenario about a bunch of
  obnoxious youtubers live-streaming their investigation of an abandoned
  hospital off the coast of Italy.  When I came across this, it spawned an
  entire campaign idea: I want to run the *rest* of the lives of these obnoxious
  youtubers, where they keep investigating stuff for their channel and most of
  it is just mundane, but *some of it* is the real deal, and the investigations
  we cover in sessions would be the real ones, with weeks or months of time
  passing for the characters (and repeated discouragement and dead ends) between
  each one.  I think that would be a great game.

And there you have it.  This month's haul of books.  I'm definitely not going to
get to use all these in the near future, but I want to at some point, and even
if I never run these things as written, just reading them is a good source of
inspiration (or so I keep telling my budget).

## Miscellaneous

I've still been playing around with [Phoenix][] a bit this week.  I think I've
got everything needed for a basic anime / movie / TV tracking site (which isn't
a very complex thing, really), including a not-terrible UI, so I guess I need to
decide if I'm really going ahead with this and---if so---begin the data entry.
