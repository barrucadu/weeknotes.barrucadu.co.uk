As the bards once sang, "well, the years start coming and they don't stop
coming," which is amply demonstrated by reaching another annual special.

## Work

Still at [GoCardless][], still on the same team.  Well, more-or-less, there's
been a re-org but the new team is basically just the old one renamed with a
couple of extra reponsibilities.

I am also still a mid-level developer.  Promotions seem hard to come by, and
what with the whole tech startup funding crunch, they've become even rarer
around these parts.  While I am well-paid, and got a raise this year, more would
always be better, you know?

I find it hard to know what to say about my work, given that it's all closed
source and commercial now, and a lot of what I do is implementing features and
making changes that we're then going to sell.  Nevertheless, this year I've
worked on various improvements to our core systems, so that we can scale to
handle more and more payments, and I've recently been working on some features
which are going out (at least in an early-access state) in the near future: but
which haven't been mentioned anywhere externally yet, so I don't think I should
really give any more detail.  I'll definitely mention in the weeknotes when
these things do launch though: I can point at it and say "I did that".

## Finance

It's been another year of steady progress towards the ultimate goal: financial
independence.

I didn't anticipate making any big changes to my financial habits this year, and
I didn't, really.  I tweaked my budget a little (and have re-done it completely
for 2024, based on historical spending), and have started being more aggressive
about keeping medium-term savings in a high-interest savings account and not in
my usual bank account, but that's about it.

My "runway"---how long it'd take to run out of money if I quit my job right now
and just lived off the current cash and investments, at today's market value,
with no lifestyle changes at all---is approaching 5 years, and I should hit that
target early next year.  Financial independence needs at least a 25-year runway,
fully invested, as that's the point where the income from the investments starts
to cover both inflation and expenses.  I'm still saving about 50% of my income,
I had hoped to be saving more by now but inflation (both economic and lifestyle)
have held that back.  So it'll take a while to get there, but progress is
happening.

My plan for 2024 is to just keep doing what I have been doing, and to be even
more aggressive about transferring medium-term savings into more efficient
accounts.  The interest may not be much, but every little helps.


## Reading

This year I read 66 books, which is pretty consistent with previous years.
Maybe slightly up, but not really by enough to indicate a trend.  I went out to
bookshops a bit more than last year, I discovered a few new authors, and that's
something I want to continue in 2024.  I also want to get into more nonfiction.
I quite enjoy history---especially ancient history---but I'm not very well-read
in the area.

I have, however, really hit the limits of physical space in my flat now.  Unless
I want to start getting rid of other things, there's no more room for
bookshelves.  My shelves aren't full yet, but they're getting there, and I could
easily fill them next year.  This means I'm going to have to start to prune my
book collection, but ultimately I should end up with a better collection: the
books I actually *want* to keep, not just everything I've ever read.

So here's what I read this year:

  - [Last and First Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_and_First_Men) by Olaf Stapledon
  - [Star Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Maker) by Olaf Stapledon

My top three books read in 2023 are:

- **Star Maker**

  Many of the books I've most enjoyed---such as *Last and First Men*,
  *Helliconia*, *The Malazan Book of the Fallen*, and so on---involve huge spans
  of time and stories of vast scope.  A poor author tries to make their
  fictional world grander by throwing in references to things which happened
  long, long ago, but without actually doing the worldbuilding to make that
  supposed past actually relevant; but when done right time lends weight to
  events.

  *Star Maker* has the biggest scope, the biggest gulf of time, it deals with
  nothing less than the entire past and future of all intelligent life in the
  cosmos, striving ever forwards to become more advanced, more civilised, more
  morally and spiritually developed, all in a grand quest to finally confront
  the Star Maker and ask Him "why?"

  It's funny that Olaf Stapledon was writing in the 1920s and 1930s, the same
  time as Lovecraft, because this is a very cosmic story and has a lot of
  similarities with Lovecraft: a mortal man is caught up in something far vaster
  and more ancient than himself, forced to witness and partake in things he
  can't possibly understand, only to then be dropped back off on the Earth to
  try to explain some of his experiences to his fellow men.  But while Lovecraft
  would have had this shatter the mind of the protagonist, turning it into a
  story of misery and horror, Olaf Stapledon gives us a mythical, almost
  religious, story full of hope and goodness, yes, but also despair and
  incomprehension.  The mind of the creature was not meant to behold the
  creator.

- **Ancient Sorceries and Other Weird Stories**

  This is one of those books I've owned for a long time and just always passed
  on reading.  I'd already read Algernon Blackwood's two most favous stories,
  *The Willows* and *The Wendigo*, and those are excellent, but if they're the
  best why read the worse stuff?  There was always some book more appealing to
  read, which didn't have the stigma of being second-best.

  But I am very glad I did eventually get around to reading this book, this
  year.  If I expected the stories in it to be much weaker, I was so very wrong.

  They're just all good weird stories, though I would say that *Sand*, which is
  about a man being roped into helping with the summoning of some ancient spirit
  in Egypt, is up there with---and possibly even better than---Algernon
  Blackwood's better-known stories.  It affected me so much that it made me want
  to go to Egypt, to try to discover some of the desert's majesty that the story
  so clearly portrays; but that itself brought about a sad realisation, that the
  Egypt of Algernon Blackwood's 1912 visit is almost certainly gone.  Egypt now
  is modern, full of tourists, thoroughly commercialised.  Where is the magic of
  the world today?

- **The Halls of Arden Vul**

  Continuing the trend of including one RPG book, this year's pick is a truly
  amazing campaign setting.  Arden Vul is a ~1200-page megadungeon---that is, a
  single dungeon large enough to be the site for a whole campaign---with 10
  levels, 15 sub-levels, and nearly 2000 keyed rooms.  I've been running it for
  over 6 months now and we've barely scratched the surface.

  Arden Vul is a dungeon with history, it's been inhabited over millennia by
  different races, who have built their own areas and repurposed areas and
  things left behind by earlier inhabitants.  Several factions inhabit the
  dungeon right now, all with their own goals and motivations.  The dungeon is
  overflowing with mysteries to solve, secrets to uncover, and denizens to
  bargain with.

  I've previously written a long post about running Arden Vul on the RPG blog:
  [My Arden Vul campaign, 6 months in][av6m].

Coincidentally, all of this year's top books involve large spans of time.

*Star Maker* takes place over a long period of time, jumping forward and
backward in history as the narrative needs.  *Sand* from *Ancient Sorceries and
Other Weird Stories* involves interacting with a remnant of the ancient world.
*The Halls of Arden Vul* is about exploring an ancient ruin and trying to figure
out forgotten secrets.


## Tech

A few small changes this year:

- I retired my instance of [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) in favour of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- I picked up [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for [bookdb](https://github.com/barrucadu/bookdb) and [bookmarks](https://github.com/barrucadu/bookmarks)
- I switched from [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to [podman](https://podman.io/) for my [NixOS-managed containers](https://nixfiles.docs.barrucadu.co.uk/modules.html#oci-containers)
- I set up documentation websites on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) for [resolved](https://resolved.docs.barrucadu.co.uk/), [dejafu](https://dejafu.docs.barrucadu.co.uk/), and my [nixfiles](https://nixfiles.docs.barrucadu.co.uk/)

But otherwise things continue more or less as usual.  I'm still happily using
NixOS (dual-booting with Windows on azathoth, my desktop machine).  I actually
spend most of azathoth's time in Windows, and SSH into either nyarlathotep or
carcosa when I want a NixOS machine.

I've got a few things in the works for 2024:

- I'm in the middle of rebuilding and upgrading nyarlathotep, after it
  mysteriously died.  Just waiting for the new motherboard to arrive.
- I'm going to do some disaster recovery thought exercises, to make sure I've
  got adequate backups of credentials, MFA recovery codes, and so on, so that I
  could bootstrap access to everything else if the worst were to happen.
- I'm planning to look into alternative secrets management mechanisms for
  [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/), as currently I use [AWS
  SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and it's a little annoying
  having this out-of-network dependency from my VPS, that I also have to pay
  for.

I've long-paused my project to migrate away from Google services, as Photos,
Drive, Docs, and Sheets are just really convenient and I don't really feel like
putting up with the hassle of migrating to some other solution.


## Gaming

There have been some hiccups this year, with players leaving and games getting
stalled, but we're not in a crisis situation right now.  In total I've played 2
systems and run another 6, with a total of 11 people across 2 groups:

- **Saturday Group**
  - **Run:** ALIEN (one-shot), Old School Essentials
  - **Played:** Mork Borg, Simple World

  Unfortunately, I've found myself drifting away from this group this year, and
  I'm not in any of the games which are likely to start up in the near future.
  This is the group that introduced me to RPGs, but I've always known that it
  has more of a narrative bent than what I really like.  And as campaigns have
  come to an end, the group has started new games in systems that just haven't
  really appealed to me.

  My OSE Dolmenwood campaign came to an inglorious end when a basilisk petrified
  the whole party except for one retainer, we were gearing up to restart the
  campaign with a new group of basilisk-hunting adventurers, but after a long
  discussion the players said that they weren't really that into the
  high-lethality OSR playstyle after all.

- **Sunday Group**
  - **Run:** Black Sword Hack (one-shot), Delta Green (one-shot), Old School
    Essentials, RuneQuest (one-shot), Traveller

  This group is still going strong, though there's been a bit of player
  turnover.  One of the original players remains, I managed to poach the one
  OSR-enjoying player from my Saturday group, and we recently recruited a new
  player by advertising on Reddit (something I'd never done before).

  In retrospect, the Traveller campaign was a mistake.  In 2022 we played a lot
  of Traveller, then had a fairly bad Wicked Ones campaign, and dove straight
  back into a new Traveller campaign.  But after a few months, we were a bit
  bored of it: we should have done something else for a while instead.

Right now I'm only running one campaign:

- The Halls of Arden Vul, using OSE.  Go check out [my post on the RPG
  blog][av6m] about Arden Vul.  It's been a lot of fun, and we're all excited to
  continue this into 2024.

I wanted to run a Delta Green campaign, but couldn't get the players for it.  So
that might be the next campaign after Arden Vul, or I might try to recruit some
more players and run both campaigns in parallel.  I really enjoyed the sanity
mechanics of Delta Green: having mechanical stats for the important
interpersonal relationships that help your character stay grounded, and having
the ability to project sanity damage onto those to reduce the damage but strain
the relationship, seems like such a great evolution of the "sanity as mental HP"
mechanic.

Finally, I've just joined a new Friday group which will be playing Pathfinder
2e.  We've done a session 0 this week, and will be kicking off the campaign in
the new year.  I've never played Pathfinder, and it's very different to the
sort of game I usually go for, so I'm interested to see how I find it.
