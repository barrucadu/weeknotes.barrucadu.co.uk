### The Halls of Arden Vul

Last week we ended on a cliffhanger with one PC and one retainer being isolated
from the rest of the party and jumped by fishmen.  We played that out via
Discord between sessions and it was a very close thing indeed, the fishmen
knocked out the retainer and very nearly managed to abscond with her deep into
their lair, but the PC was able to pull her out at the last moment with a very
good use of a cone of fear!

With that behind us, this time we did some more adventuring, identified some
more of the haul of magic items the players got by defeating the Cult of Set,
and further narrowed down where one of the missing rudishva survivors,
Ravatorus, is.  We ended the session with them hot on his trail.  It'll be very
fun when the players discover they've tracked him down to the territory of the
fishmen, the very same fishmen who tried to abduct them as "material for the
master".


## Miscellaneous

This week I got really back into Crusader Kings 3 and spent a lot of my evenings
*actually learning to play the game properly*, which honestly I don't think I
really did previously.  I just sort of carried over my uunderstanding of CK2,
and so I was just bad at CK3.  I'd always give up a game a few generations in
because I'd have too little money, be losing my land to neighbouring kingdoms,
be dealing with frequent vassal rebellions... but this morning I finished a
play-through at the game end date (which I'd never got close to reaching before)
with a powerhouse of an empire.  Looking forward to more games where I know what
I'm doing!

I've taken next week off work, so maybe I'll do another long CK3 game, but I'm
also kind of feeling like getting back into Dyson Sphere Program, as I've not
played that properly since they added the Dark Fog.
