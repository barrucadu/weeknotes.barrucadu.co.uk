### Sylea Rising

This week I kicked off my new Traveller campaign, called Sylea Rising.  It's set
during the [Long Night][], a nearly 2000-year-long period of galactic anarchy
between the fall of one great space empire (the Rule of Man) and the rise of the
next (the Third Imperium)[^foundation].

[^foundation]: Yes, this part of the Traveller setting is obviously inspired by
  Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* series: the first emperor of the Third Imperium is
  even called "Cleon", and he uses psychohistory to help his fledgling empire
  succeed!

The game is set in Lishun Sector, here's the map I gave the players:

![Lishun Sector](notes/219/lishun-poster--players.png)

It looks pretty empty at first, but look a little closer: there are a lot of
question marks.

Those are worlds which were, once, well-known.  This isn't unexplored, unmapped,
space.  But it's been close to 2000 years since anyone has visited those worlds,
so nobody really knows what's going on out there.  My [secret referee map][] is
a bit more detailed, but there's still a lot of blank space to populate with
whatever I'm in the mood for at the time.

To make these maps, I took the Lishun data from the [Traveller Map][] (great
resource) and wrote a library to [interact with sector data files][].  It was
then just a matter of writing a little script to make everywhere worse: about
10% of worlds I killed off (set the population to 0, with a 25% chance of having
a basic starport still there), for the surviving worlds I re-rolled the
population, starport, and tech level (set to be 1 lower than standard, and
capped at 12).

I spent far too much time working on that library, I could probably have done it
manually in less time, since I didn't really need to prepare the *whole* sector
up front.  But it's done now.

The setting has---well, not exactly a *secret*---but a facet I don't think the
players have picked up on yet: they know the game is set some time before the
founding of the Third Imperium, and they know that the Sylean Federation is one
of the largest and most successful interstellar polities in this period, and the
campaign is called "Sylea Rising" so clearly it gets even bigger and
better... but I've not come straight out and told them the Sylean Federation
will become the Third Imperium and that they'll see that happen.

The campaign isn't about large-scale politics, so they won't play a part in that
coming to pass, but I'm hoping it'll be a fun moment for the players of our
previous campaign when it does happen.

This week we had our session 0: I gave them a run-down of the setting, we talked
about the tone and themes of the campaign, then we made characters.  The
campaign proper will start next week, and I'm planning to run them through
[Murder on Arcturus Station][] (just not, you know, set *on* Arcturus since
that's sectors away---some closer world will do).

## Miscellaneous

This week I [switched to using chezmoi][] for my dotfiles.  [chezmoi][] is a
dotfile manager plus a basic templating system, so you can have different
dotfiles on different machines.  I decided to switch because I had a few
differences which I wasn't really tracking, which isn't great.  It's fairly
simple and wasn't much effort at all to get set up.  Encoding metadata in
filenames is a bit weird, but it's something I can live with.
