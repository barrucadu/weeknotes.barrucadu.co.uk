## Books

This week I read:

- [Ancient Sorceries and Other Weird Stories][], a collection of short stories by Algernon Blackwood

  I've read *The Willows* before, of course, and *The Wendigo* too.  Those are
  always hyped as the best Algernon Blackwood stories and, while they're both
  very good, I actually felt that *Sand* in this collection blew them both out
  of the water.  I'm amazed I haven't seen anyone talking about it before.

  AB is really good at portraying the majesty and mystery of nature, which is
  seemingly largely drawn from his own experiences.  The endnotes of this
  collection surprised me by how closely related these stories all were to
  experiences he himself had, just with the weirdness turned up.  You can tell
  that he felt there was something magical in the world---something known to the
  ancients but now largely hidden out of sight---and he shares his vision of
  that through his stories.

  *Sand*, in particular, I found very touching.  It made me want to go to Egypt,
  to see the endless desert stretch away before me and to feel the weight of
  ages.  But that itself brought about a sad realisation: the magical Egypt of
  AB's 1912 visit is almost certainly gone.  With the modernisation of Egypt
  itself, and the hordes of tourists who now descend upon it, an age of mystery
  and wonder has ended.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

This week my players made a plan before the session.  This is great.  I love
talking about the game (it's so fun), and I love plans (I can focus my prep).

They didn't actually follow the plan once the session started, but I suppose you
can't have everything.  But they did find a few fun things: they managed to pick
the lock of a big door which had defeated them previously, gaining access to a
new region of the main dungeon level they're exploring (and also unleashing a
dust monster in the process, we'll see what comes of that); they decoded one of
my clues leading to a connection with a different level; and they found a *very*
significant item (though they don't know it yet) which ties in with some of the
hidden deep lore of the setting.

In less good news, our VTT of choice, [Owlbear Rodeo][] was pretty laggy today.
I've heard that it can strugle with big drawn maps, but I didn't think we'd
reached that point yet.  Hopefully it was just a temporary issue today, and not
a sign that we'll need to switch to another tool.

## Miscellaneous

I was seized by inspiration to make some improvements to [my DNS nameserver][]
this weekend:

- Making a simplifying assumption in the main resolver ([#261][])
- Fixing [an issue with negative responses][] ([#262][], [#263][])
- Adding basic IPv6 support ([#264][], [#265][], [#266][])
- And making the upstream DNS port configurable ([#267][])

The combination of #264, #265, and #267 make it possible to implement
integration tests on a single host.  I could run a mock nameserver on, say, port
5354, and resolved on port 5353 configured to talk to it.  Then I just need to
hard-code responses to all the queries my mock nameserver may get, then use
`dig` or something to query resolved and check the responses are correct.  I
haven't written any integration tests yet, but I think it would be a valuable
exercise.
