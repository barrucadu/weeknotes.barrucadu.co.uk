## Japan

The trip was great.  I got back on Thursday, tired after a 14-hour flight with
two crying babies (they'd be quiet for a while, then one would start to cry,
which would set the other one off, and they'd enter a vicious cycle of louder
and louder crying until the parents managed to shut them up; I would be totally
in favour of banning babies from planes, if you want to take your loud spawn
abroad, use a transport mechanism that lets you isolate them, like boats), and
have been recovering from the jetlag.

We spent a couple of days in Tokyo while everyone arrived, then a week in Osaka,
then another week in Tokyo.  I also broke away for one weekend to visit some
other friends in Matsuyama.

Here are a few things I noticed:

- Things seemed a bit less cash-based than when I was there in 2018.  I still
  used a lot of cash, but I felt like there were also more options to pay by
  card, and most of the convenience stores had machines to feed cash into and
  count the change automatically, rather than needing the human cashier to do
  that.

- Even taking the exchange rate into account, the day-to-day living expenses are
  pretty low.  The Tokyo hotels were expensive, but food and transport were
  cheap enough that we could ride the subway everywhere and eat out at
  restaurants every day without worry.

- Even the cheap stuff is good quality.  A 300 yen convenience store onigiri,
  about £1.50, tastes good and is nourishing enough to be breakfast.

- There are almost no bins in public.  So after eating the aforementioned
  onigiri, you end up carrying the empty packaging around for hours.  I took to
  always bringing a bag with me to fill with the rubbish I produced.

- The Japanese *love* their single-use plastic packaging.  You'd buy, say, a bag
  of snacks and find that inside the bag, each snack is individually wrapped in
  its own smaller bit of plastic.  This does not combine well with the bin
  situation.

- It's quiet.  One day we were walking around a busy part of Osaka and someone
  remarked that unless you really listened... you couldn't actually hear any
  other conversation.

- You're never more than 5 minutes away from a well-stocked public drinks
  vending machine.  They all accept cash and many of them accept card too.  I'm
  already missing these in the UK.

- Cyclists will just awkwardly follow you and not ring their bell.  I think
  you're supposed to telepathically sense the bike behind you and move aside
  unprompted.

- Bidets everywhere.  I saw more public toilets with bidets than I saw public
  bins.

One day we visited an owl place in Kyoto, leading to my favourite photo of the
trip:

One slight problem I had during the trip was with my finance tracking.  I have
two bank accounts and had my holiday budget stored in the one that gave me the
better exchange rate (and doesn't change an FX fee), but the *other* one is
where my credit card direct debit comes from, and whenever I paid for things
with card I used my credit card.  So I had to periodically sweep money from the
one account to the other, to put it aside for the credit card liability, but for
some reason the credit card transactions were taking 3 or 4 days to appear on my
statement which meant I didn't really know how much I had to sweep until days
after the transaction.

This led to an entirely self-imposed problem, in that I have some validation on
my finance tracking that raises an error if I spend money on my credit card
without---on the *same day*---putting the same amount of money aside to pay it
off.  This is normally good, as it effectively forces me to treat my credit card
as if I always paid it off instantly, which prevents overspending.  But in this
case I had the choice of sweeping late (and tripping the validation) or
estimating the amount to sweep (and *maybe* tripping the validation).

I think the way I'd handle this for another trip is to leave a small buffer, say
£50, in my main bank account to cover FX-related discrepancies, and to sweep the
estimated amount on the same day as the transaction.  That should ensure I
always have at least enough put aside.


## Books

While on planes and trains (but not automobiles) these past few weeks, I read:

- [Kingdoms of Elfin][] a collection of short stories by Sylvia Townsend Warner
- [Of Cats and Elfins][] another collection of short stories by Sylvia Townsend Warner
- [Strange Relics][] a third collection of short stories, by various authors

All these books were published by [Handheld Press][].  I have a couple of others
from them too, and I've always been impressed with not just the content, but
also the physical quality of the books.  Sadly, it looks like Handheld Press is
closing down next year, so I'll have to pick up at least all their fantasy and
sci-fi books before then.

## Roleplaying Games

### The Halls of Arden Vul

Today we resumed the campaign... with a TPK.  A bold choice, but hear me out.

Last time, the party split, with half of them stranded in a very dangerous
location.  This time, we played through all the stranded people dying horribly
over the course of three hours.  We had:

- One PC and one NPC get hacked to pieces by serpent-people.
- One NPC get torn apart by a vengeful ghost.
- The remaining one PC and four retainers get pummelled into the ground by an
  animated statue.

I checked in with the players throughout and it was all fine.  A relief in a
sense, actually, as they'd spent the past three weeks thinking about this bad
situation they had found themselves in---and the situation has now been
resolved.

Next time we're picking up an in-game week later, with the other half of the
party having assumed the worst and stared recruiting new members.

Then back to exploration.  Of some less dangerous places.
